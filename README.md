THERE ARE Two PROJECTS IN THIS DIRECTORY

PROJECT 1:credit_card_fraud_detection DESCRIPTION-:Logistic regression is used in credit card fraud detection by modeling the probability of a transaction being fraudulent based on input features like transaction amount, location, and time. It classifies transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent by fitting a logistic curve to the data. The model learns from historical fraud patterns to identify suspicious transactions in real-time, helping prevent financial losses for cardholders and issuers. Key steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a production environment for continuous monitoring. Advanced techniques like ensemble learning and anomaly detection can complement logistic regression for improved fraud detection accuracy.

At last we use streamlit to deploy app and make a user interface

PORJECT 2:sms spam classifier:-train a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the spam sms.
